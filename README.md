# Virtual Tourist
Virtual Tourist is a photo exploring app written in Swift. This app was built as my final project for [Udacity iOS Developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree). 

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/duris/Virtual-Tourist`

## Usage
Touch and hold the map in a location of interest. A pin will drop and start downloading photos. You can move the pin around until you release your finger. Tap the pin to see the photos around that location. You can load a new collection of photos by tapping the "New Collection" button. Touching a photo will delete it from the list and remove it from the local image cache.
